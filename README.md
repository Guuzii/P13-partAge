## Installation

Clone project then, in a terminal, place yourself in the project directory, create a virtual env and activate it.

Run the following command :
- Virtualenv
```
    pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Create a new database in PostgreSQL that will be the DB for the app.

Configure access to the database by modifying the DATABASES variable in partAgePlatform/settings/\__init\__.py then run the following commands to create app's tables in the DB and create a new admin user :
```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py update_refs all
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Custom commands

Most of the apps have their own custom command that can be directly called with manage.py command :

- user          =   update_refs_user

```
python3 manage.py update_refs <appName>
```

Those commands can be used to apply changes in settings refs datas to DB.
